# Roadflow Frontend

This is the frontend for Roadflow website, it curates curriculums and syllabus for tech roles and tools for new developers or experts to use. It allows progress tracking, curriculum reviews using MindsDB, and quizzes to verify that students understand the concept taught. Roadflow does not create new video or article resources but leverages on free contents on the internet. Sources for resources includes but not limited to Youtube, Hashnode, Medium, Coursera, and Udemy etc.

## Getting Started

You need to run the api first, as the frontend heavily depends on the api that provides more technical features like Signup, Login and more.

### Running the API

Visit [Roadflow API repository](https://github.com/devvspaces/roadflow-api) to set up the API.

### Setup

Make sure you update the `.env.development` file to use the BASE URL of the API server.

### Usage

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
